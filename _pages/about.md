I am Hao Cheng (程淏). 
Currently, I working toward the Ph.D. degree in Mechanics at Peking University, China, under the supervision of [Prof. Feitian Zhang](http://www2.coe.pku.edu.cn/faculty/zhangfeitian/). 
My research interests include Light-Than-Air (LTA) aerial robots, continuum robots, and bioinspired robotics.
